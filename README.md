# Data Visualization: Best practices for Creating Visuals

## Importance of data visualization
- Allows you to represent data in a manner that’s interpretable by giving it a visual context.
- Easier to identify trends, patters, outliers & anomalies.
- A picture is worth a thousand words

## Best practices for data visualization
- Identify your target audience
- Resist the temptation to cater to everyone. Something for everyone is for no one.
- What decision do they expect to make after viewing the presentation?
- Clean your data – identify inaccuracies like missing values, outliers or malformed data
- Ensure data isn’t skewed & computations are accurate
- Select the right visualization type
- Provide context & label your chart effectively – use captions, provide value labels & do not depend on chart element sizes are people often misinterpret those
- Keep visualizations & dashboards simple
- Use color effectively but don’t overwhelm them
- Use intuitive colors – green for positives, red for negatives
- Explicitly clarify what different colors mean & what they represent
- Use grouping to simplify visualization
- Make your data readable in any format – small, large devices, etc.
- Use contrast in layouts so elements are clearly visible
