# Data Visualization: Best practices for Creating Visuals

## Importance of data visualization
- Allows you to represent data in a manner that’s interpretable by giving it a visual context.
- Easier to identify trends, patters, outliers & anomalies.
- A picture is worth a thousand words

## Best practices for data visualization
- Identify your target audience
- Resist the temptation to cater to everyone. Something for everyone is for no one.
- What decision do they expect to make after viewing the presentation?
- Clean your data – identify inaccuracies like missing values, outliers or malformed data
- Ensure data isn’t skewed & computations are accurate
- Select the right visualization type
- Provide context & label your chart effectively – use captions, provide value labels & do not depend on chart element sizes are people often misinterpret those
- Keep visualizations & dashboards simple
- Use color effectively but don’t overwhelm them
- Use intuitive colors – green for positives, red for negatives
- Explicitly clarify what different colors mean & what they represent
- Use grouping to simplify visualization
- Make your data readable in any format – small, large devices, etc.
- Use contrast in layouts so elements are clearly visible

## Presentation types
Presentation types can be compared into 5 broad categories:
- *Comparison* – comparison of values across categories
- *Distribution* – what is the normal tendency & distribution
- *Relationship* – how does 1 variable relate to others
- *Composition* - how do individual parts make up a whole
- *Trends* – how did values perform over a certain time period

**Comparison charts**: Bar charts/Column charts, Line charts, Pie charts
**Composition charts**: Pie charts – have fallen out of favor because it’s hard to view proportions of circular shapes using angles, Stacked bar charts, Area charts, Tree maps
**Distribution charts**: Histogram, Line chart, Scatter plot
**Relationship charts**: Scatter charts, Bubble charts
**Trend charts**: Line charts, Circular area charts

## Tables
#### Use cases
- Usually represent source data used for analysis & visualization
- If the size of the data is really small, we might choose to use the table itself for visualization
- Can be used for comparison, composition, relationship analysis
- Used when there are very few variables in input data, for large sizes tables are overwhelming
